# :airplane: Credit Rewards Converter :airplane:

This is the project repo for the JPMC Software Engineering Lite Program, 

Task Description:
In the credit rewards department at JPMorgan Chase, the team handles conversions between different types of currencies such as dollars, credit card points, and airline miles. The task at hand involves working on the RewardsConverter system, which requires the creation of a crucial class to enable its functionality. This class, called RewardValue, will serve as the representation of the correspondence between various currencies, including cash, airline miles, and others. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the conversion between these different scales of value. The task involves setting up your local development environment for coding and implementing the RewardValue class, ensuring that the system can accurately convert a given cash value into the corresponding value in airline miles.
